   - Duration (represents a span of time)

9. std::hash:
   - Hash (trait for hashing objects)
   - BuildHasher (trait for implementing custom hashers)

30. std::sync::Once:
    - Mechanism for running an initialization closure only once

These are the main internal libraries in Rust that are directly related to algorithms or provide utilities for algorithmic tasks. Rust's standard library is regularly updated, so new features and improvements may be introduced over time.
