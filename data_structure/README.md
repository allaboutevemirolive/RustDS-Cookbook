Rust is a programming language that provides a rich ecosystem of libraries for various purposes, including data structures. Here's an exhaustive list of internal libraries in Rust that relate to data structures or can be helpful in working with data structures:

1. std::collections:
   - BTreeMap
   - BTreeSet
   - BinaryHeap
   - HashMap
   - HashSet
   - LinkedList
   - VecDeque
   - VecMap

2. std::cmp:
   - Reverse (wrapper struct for reversing ordering)

3. std::hash:
   - BuildHasher (trait for implementing custom hashers)
   - Hash (trait for hashing objects)
   - Hasher (trait for computing hash values)

4. std::iter:
   - empty (function to create an empty iterator)
   - once (function to create an iterator with a single element)
   - repeat (function to create an iterator that repeats a value)
   - FromIterator (trait for converting an iterator into a collection)
   - IntoIterator (trait for converting a collection into an iterator)

5. std::mem:
   - swap (function to swap the values of two variables)
   - transmute (function to reinterpret the bits of a value)

6. std::ptr:
   - null (constant for a null raw pointer)
   - null_mut (constant for a null mutable raw pointer)
   - drop_in_place (function to explicitly drop a value without running its destructor)
   - read (function to read a value from a raw pointer)
   - write (function to write a value to a raw pointer)
   - copy_nonoverlapping (function to copy a block of memory between raw pointers)
   - slice_from_raw_parts (function to create a slice from a raw pointer and a length)

7. std::rc:
   - Rc (reference-counted smart pointer for shared ownership)

8. std::sync:
   - Arc (atomically reference-counted smart pointer for shared ownership)

9. std::cell:
   - RefCell (a mutable memory location with dynamically checked borrow rules)
   - Cell (a mutable memory location without borrowing restrictions)

10. std::marker:
    - PhantomData (a zero-sized marker type used to indicate ownership or variance in generics)

11. std::vec:
    - Vec (a dynamically-sized, heap-allocated vector)

12. std::slice:
    - SliceIndex (trait for indexing into slices)
    - Iter (an iterator over elements of a slice)

This list covers the main internal libraries in Rust that are directly related to data structures or provide helpful utilities for working with them. Keep in mind that Rust's standard library is regularly updated, so new features and improvements may be introduced over time.
